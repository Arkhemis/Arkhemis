Hi, I'm Alexandre Vessereau, a data scientist primarly interested in Natural Language Processing and Finance.
I graduated with a Master in Economy and Psychology at Université Paris-I Panthéon-Sorbonne, Université de Paris and the Paris School of Economics, in 2021.

I'm currently a Data Science teacher on various technologies, mainly Alteryx.

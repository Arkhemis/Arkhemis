Hi, I'm Alexandre Vessereau, a data scientist primarly interested in Natural Language Processing, Behavioral Economy, Marketing and Finance.
I graduated with a Master in Economy and Psychology at Université Paris-I Panthéon-Sorbonne, Université de Paris and the Paris School of Economics, in 2021.

I'm currently a Data Science teacher on various technologies, mainly Alteryx.

The repository for my M2 thesis can be found here: https://github.com/Arkhemis/M2_EcoPsycho_Thesis. Its corresponding paper is no longer available, due to a submission process in a journal. It will be back as soon as it has been published.

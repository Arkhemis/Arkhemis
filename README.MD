Hi, I'm Alexandre Vessereau, a data scientist and economist primarly interested in how can we apply Natural Language Processing and machine learning methods on subjets as Behavioral Economics or Marketing.
I graduated with a Master in Economy, Specialisation in Behavioral Economics, at Université Paris-I Panthéon-Sorbonne, Université de Paris and the Paris School of Economics, in 2021.

I'm currently a Data Science teacher on various technologies.

The repository for my M2 thesis can be found here: https://github.com/Arkhemis/M2_EcoPsycho_Thesis. Its corresponding paper is no longer available, due to a submission process in a journal. It will be back as soon as it has been published.

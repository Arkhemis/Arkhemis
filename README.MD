Hi, I'm Alexandre V., a data scientist and economist primarly interested in how can we apply machine learning methods on Behavioral Economics or Marketing topics.
I graduated with a Master in Economy, Specialisation in Behavioral Economics, at Université Paris-I Panthéon-Sorbonne, Université de Paris and the Paris School of Economics, in 2021.

Worked on various technologies, latest is to deliver an full-fleshed mobile app developed on Flutter/Supabase.

The repository for my M2 thesis can be found here: https://github.com/Arkhemis/M2_EcoPsycho_Thesis. Its corresponding paper is no longer available, due to a submission process in a journal. It will be back as soon as it has been published.
